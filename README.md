The Road Traffic Accident Forecasting System is designed to analyze and predict accident trends using advanced data mining techniques. It integrates the Bayesian algorithm for probabilistic forecasting and the J48 classifier for decision tree modeling to identify key factors contributing to road accidents. The system processes historical accident data, including environmental conditions, driver behavior, vehicle information, time, demographics, and location details, to generate accurate forecasts and summaries. It provides visual reports and predictive insights to support traffic authorities in decision-making, accident prevention strategies, and road safety management.
